I am a Cybersecurity College Student. I mostly like to solve machines on TryHackMe and HackTheBox and I also participate in capture the flag competitions. Here I am writing these writeups as my hobby. I hope you like them. Besides these, I like to read books.

I know some Python, C, and I am a Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical).
