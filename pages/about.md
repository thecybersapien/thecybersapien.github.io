I am a Cybersecurity Enthusiast. I like to solve coding problems using Python. 

I am also a [Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNm0BA837_kds7ITUTGTjpvIyeq5j93R/view). I'm currently learning Application Security in my free time.

I work for a company ([BreachLock](https://www.breachlock.com/)) that provides Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS). I work as an Associate Security Automation Engineer in the company, where I am part of the Security Automation Team and write code for an automated vulnerability scanner.

I sometimes solve machines on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/cybersapien) and [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/192218), and I also participate and create challenges in the Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Here I am writing these writeups as my hobby. I hope you like them. Besides these, I like to read books.
