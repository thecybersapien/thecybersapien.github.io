I am a Cybersecurity Enthusiast. I like to solve coding problems using Python. 

I know some Python and C, and I am also a [Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNm0BA837_kds7ITUTGTjpvIyeq5j93R/view).

I work for a company ([BreachLock](https://www.breachlock.com/)) which provides Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS). I work as a Associate Security Automation Engineer in my company where I am part of Scanner (RATA) Team in which I write code for our automated scanner for Web Penetration Testing.

I also like to solve machines on TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and I also participate and create challenges in capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Here I am writing these writeups as my hobby. I hope you like them. Besides these, I like to read books.
